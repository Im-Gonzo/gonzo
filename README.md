## Introduction

Are you tired of spending hours configuring your local development environment? Our Local Dev Environment Setup CLI automates the process, allowing you to focus on coding, not setup. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this tool streamlines the setup of local development environments with a few simple commands.

## Features

- **Efficiency Beyond Compare:** Imagine reducing the hours spent setting up local development environments to just a few commands. This CLI tool, akin to a "terraform apply" for local development, dramatically cuts down setup times.

- **Streamlined Environment Setup:** With minimal effort, developers can effortlessly create fully functional local development environments. No more wrestling with configurations or troubleshooting; it's as easy as a few keystrokes.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, you'll need Python and `pip` installed on your system. Detailed installation instructions will be provided soon.

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the CLI tool to automate your project environment setup. Here are some basic usage examples:

```sh
# Create a new project environment
local-dev-setup create my-new-project

# Configure your environment
local-dev-setup configure component-name

# Start your local development environment
local-dev-setup start
```
## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is in progress. We are actively working on detailed guides, tutorials, and examples to help you harness the full potential of this tool. Stay tuned for updates.
